<h3 id="submittingacodereview">Submitting a Code Review</h3>
<p>(For setting up your <a href="#environment">local environment, see below</a>.)</p>
<p>Before you submit your pull request consider the following guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Search <a href="https://github.com/collab-ui/collab-library/pulls">GitHub</a> for an open or closed Pull Request
that relates to your submission. You don't want to duplicate effort.</p></li>
<li><p>Make your changes in a new git branch:</p>
<p><code>shell
 git checkout -b my-fix-branch master
</code></p></li>
<li><p>Create your patch, <strong>including appropriate test cases</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Follow our <a href="#rules">Coding Rules</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Commit your changes using a descriptive commit message that follows our
<a href="#commit-message-format">commit message conventions</a>. Adherence to the <a href="#commit-message-format">commit message conventions</a>
is required because release notes are automatically generated from these messages.</p>
<p><code>shell
 git commit -a
</code>
Note: the optional commit <code>-a</code> command line option will automatically "add" and "rm" edited files.</p></li>
<li><p>Build your changes locally to ensure all the tests pass:</p>
<pre><code class="shell language-shell">gulp build
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Push your branch to GitHub:</p>
<pre><code class="shell language-shell">git push origin my-fix-branch
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>In GitHub, send a pull request to <code>collab-ui:master</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>If we suggest changes then:</p></li>
<li><p>Make the required updates.</p></li>
<li><p>Re-run the Symphony UI test suite to ensure tests are still passing.</p></li>
<li><p>Commit your changes to your branch (e.g. <code>my-fix-branch</code>).</p></li>
<li><p>Push the changes to your GitHub repository (this will update your Pull Request).</p></li>
<li><p>If the PR gets too outdated we may ask you to rebase and force push to update the PR:</p>
<pre><code class="shell language-shell">git rebase master -i
git push origin my-fix-branch -f
</code></pre></li>
</ul>
<p><em>WARNING. Squashing or reverting commits and forced push thereafter may remove GitHub comments
on code that were previously made by you and others in your commits.</em></p>
<p>That's it! Thank you for your contribution!</p>
<h4 id="afteryourpullrequestismerged">After your pull request is merged</h4>
<p>After your pull request is merged, you can safely delete your branch and pull the changes
from the main (upstream) repository:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Delete the remote branch on GitHub either through the GitHub web UI or your local shell as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="shell language-shell">git push origin --delete my-fix-branch
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Check out the master branch:</p>
<pre><code class="shell language-shell">git checkout master -f
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Delete the local branch:</p>
<pre><code class="shell language-shell">git branch -D my-fix-branch
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Update your master with the latest upstream version:</p>
<pre><code class="shell language-shell">git pull --ff upstream master
</code></pre></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="anamecommitagitcommitguidelines"><a name="commit"></a> Git Commit Guidelines</h2>
<p>We have very precise rules over how our git commit messages can be formatted.  This leads to <strong>more
readable messages</strong> that are easy to follow when looking through the <strong>project history</strong>.  But also,
we use the git commit messages to <strong>generate the Angular change log</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="commitmessageformat">Commit Message Format</h3>
<p>Each commit message consists of a <strong>header</strong>, a <strong>body</strong> and a <strong>footer</strong>.  The header has a special
format that includes a <strong>type</strong>, a <strong>scope</strong> and a <strong>subject</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;type&gt;(&lt;scope&gt;): &lt;subject&gt;
&lt;BLANK LINE&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;BLANK LINE&gt;
&lt;footer&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The <strong>header</strong> is mandatory and the <strong>scope</strong> of the header is optional.</p>
<p>Any line of the commit message cannot be longer 100 characters! This allows the message to be easier
to read on GitHub as well as in various git tools.</p>
<p>Footer should contain a <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/">closing reference to an issue</a> if any.</p>
<p>Samples: (even more <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular/commits/master">samples</a>)</p>
<pre><code>docs(changelog): update change log to beta.5
</code></pre>
<pre><code>fix(release): need to depend on latest rxjs and zone.js

The version in our package.json gets copied to the one we publish, and users need the latest of these.
</code></pre>
<h3 id="revert">Revert</h3>
<p>If the commit reverts a previous commit, it should begin with <code>revert:</code>, followed by the header of the reverted commit. In the body it should say: <code>This reverts commit &lt;hash&gt;.</code>, where the hash is the SHA of the commit being reverted.</p>
<h3 id="type">Type</h3>
<p>Must be one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>feat</strong>: A new feature</li>
<li><strong>fix</strong>: A bug fix</li>
<li><strong>docs</strong>: Documentation only changes</li>
<li><strong>style</strong>: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing
semi-colons, etc)</li>
<li><strong>refactor</strong>: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature</li>
<li><strong>perf</strong>: A code change that improves performance</li>
<li><strong>test</strong>: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests</li>
<li><strong>build</strong>: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)</li>
<li><strong>ci</strong>: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Travis, Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs)</li>
<li><strong>chore</strong>: Other changes that don't modify <code>src</code> or <code>test</code> files</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="scope">Scope</h3>
<p>The scope could be anything specifying place of the commit change. For example
<code>Compiler</code>, <code>ElementInjector</code>, etc.</p>
<h3 id="subject">Subject</h3>
<p>The subject contains succinct description of the change:</p>
<ul>
<li>use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"</li>
<li>don't capitalize first letter</li>
<li>no dot (.) at the end</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="body">Body</h3>
<p>Just as in the <strong>subject</strong>, use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes".
The body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.</p>
<h3 id="footer">Footer</h3>
<p>The footer should contain any information about <strong>Breaking Changes</strong> and is also the place to
reference GitHub issues that this commit <strong>Closes</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Breaking Changes</strong> should start with the word <code>BREAKING CHANGE:</code> with a space or two newlines. The rest of the commit message is then used for this.</p>
<p><strong>Referencing issues</strong> Closed bugs should be listed on a separate line in the footer prefixed with "Closes" keyword like this:</p>
<p><code>Closes #234</code></p>
<p>or in case of multiple issues:</p>
<p><code>Closes #123, #245, #992</code></p>
<h2 id="anameenvironmentasettingupyourlocaldevelopmentenvironment"><a name="environment"></a> Setting Up Your Local Development Environment</h2>
<h3 id="setupyourrepository">Setup your repository</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>git clone git@wwwin-github.cisco.com:collab-ui/collab-library.git</code></li>
<li><code>origin</code> should be the above collab-ui repo (<code>git remote -v</code> to see remote details)</li>
<li>See <a href="git-workflows.md">Git Workflows</a> for alternative detail on how to manage your git repository.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="installingthetoolkit">Installing the Toolkit</h3>
<ul>
<li>install node.js version &gt;=v 4.2.0: <a href="http://nodejs.org/download/">http://nodejs.org/download/</a></li>
<li>Run package managers in the cloned project to pull dependencies: <code>npm install</code></li>
<li>Launch the app: <code>gulp serve</code></li>
<li>Before pushing to a PR, always use <code>git pull --rebase</code></li>
<li>After git pulls, run <code>npm install</code> to make sure to pull new dependencies.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="typescriptdefinitions">TypeScript Definitions</h3>
<p>TypeScript definitions are included in the project for enhanced intellisense in most IDEs</p>
<ul>
<li>Run 'gulp tsd' to install configured TypeScript definitions from tsd.json</li>
<li>Definitions (*.d.ts files) are installed under typings directory.</li>
<li>Microsoft VSCode automatically detects definition files and provides IntelliSense support (https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/javascript)</li>
<li>Add new TypeScript definitions using tsd (TypeScript Definition manager) from DefinitelyTyped (https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/tsd)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="anamerulesacodingguidelines"><a name="rules"></a> Coding Guidelines</h2>
<p>To ensure consistency throughout the source code, keep these rules in mind as you are working:</p>
<ul>
<li>All features or bug fixes must be tested by one or more specs.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are several libraries that are combined to form the Collab UI Tookit. Each one is managed in its own GitHub repo.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wwwin-github.cisco.com/collab-ui/collab-ui">collab-ui</a> - HTML, SCSS, icons, fonts, images</li>
<li><a href="https://wwwin-github.cisco.com/collab-ui/collab-ui-ng">collab-ui-ng</a> - Angular 1.X components, directives and services</li>
<li><a href="https://wwwin-github.cisco.com/collab-ui/collab-ui-angular">collab-ui-angular</a> - Angular 2+ components, directives and services</li>
<li><a href="https://wwwin-github.cisco.com/collab-ui/collab-ui-formly">collab-ui-formly</a> - Angular Formly</li>
</ul>
<p>You will need to clone the individual repositories of the libraries that you will be contributing to. To view the examples in the Collab Library, you will need to <code>npm link</code> the library repo to your local Collab Library installation. To do so, do the following (this example is for the collab-ui library):</p>
<ul>
<li>In the terminal, navigate to the directory where you have cloned and installed the collab-ui library</li>
<li>run <code>npm link</code></li>
<li>run <code>gulp watch</code> (or whatever the development/watch task is for that library)</li>
<li>In another terminal tab/window, navigate to the directory where you have cloned and installed the Collab Library</li>
<li>run <code>npm start</code> to build, serve and watch the collab-library files</li>
</ul>
<p>Now when you make changes in the collab-ui library, they will build and cause the collab-library to see the updated files and rebuild and show your changes. Repeate for each of the libraries that you are developing. (i.e. to add/edit a component in the collab-ui-ng library for Angular, you will probably also need to run the collab-ui library for styling simultaneously).</p>
